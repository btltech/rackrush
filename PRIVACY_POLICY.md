**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026

## Introduction
Use of RackRush and RackRush Kids (the "Apps") is subject to this Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe experience for all users, especially children.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect any personal data.**
- The Apps function primarily offline.
- We do not require account registration.
- We do not track your location.
- We do not collect names, emails, or phone numbers.

## Kids Privacy (COPPA Compliance)
RackRush Kids and the Kids Mode feature in RackRush are designed to be safe for children.
- **No Data Collection:** We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.
- **Offline First:** Core gameplay, dictionary definitions, and pronunciation work entirely offline to ensure safety.
- **No Ads:** There are no third-party advertisements in the Kids Mode/App.

## Third-Party Services
The Apps may make limited use of the following third-party services for specific non-personal functionality:
- **Dictionary API:** If a word definition is not found locally, the App may query `api.dictionaryapi.dev` to retrieve a definition. This query contains only the word itself and your IP address (standard web request), which is not stored or effectively associated with any user identity by us.
- **Apple Game Center:** If you choose to use Game Center features (leaderboards/achievements), you are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy. We do not store your Game Center data on our servers.
